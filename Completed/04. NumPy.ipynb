    "## Log Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithmic returns are often used in finance due to their useful statistical properties. They are **additive over time**, making them ideal for analysing historical returns across multiple periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You invest £100\n",
    "* On the first day, the simple return is +10% → your investment grows to £110\n",
    "* On the second day, the simple return is -10% → your investment drops to £99\n",
    "\n",
    "Using simple returns, you might assume the net change is 0%, since +10% and -10% appear to cancel out. But in reality, you've lost £1 — a **-1%** return overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithmic returns correctly account for compounding. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Day 1: $\\ln(110 / 100) ≈ 0.09531$\n",
    "* Day 2: $\\ln(99 / 110) ≈ -0.10536$\n",
    "* Total log return: $0.09531 + (-0.10536) = -0.01005$\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert back to a simple return:\n",
    "$e^{-0.01005} - 1 ≈ -0.01$ → **-1%**, matching the actual loss.\n",
